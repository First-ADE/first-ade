## Project Identity

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AXIOM ACCEPTANCE**: You **MUST** read and accept the [ADE Core Axioms](https://github.com/First-ADE/.github/blob/main/docs/AXIOMS.md) before proceeding. Explicitly state your acceptance of these axioms before interacting with any specification files.

## Core Principles (ADE)

This project follows Axiom Driven Engineering:

1. **Σ.1 Specification Primacy** — No code without specs
2. **Σ.2 Deterministic Verification** — Tests must be reproducible
3. **Σ.3 Traceable Rationale** — ADRs for all decisions
4. **Σ.4 Emergent Complexity** — Simple components compose
5. **Σ.5 AI Symbiosis** — You're part of the team

## Working with This Codebase

### Before implementing anything:
1. Check `.specify/specs/` for existing specifications
2. Review `docs/decisions/` for architectural decisions
3. Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project rules

### When implementing:
1. Write failing tests first (Π.2.1)
2. Commit with `test: add failing test for X`
3. Implement minimal solution
4. Commit with `feat: implement X`

### Commit message format:
```
type(scope): description

Refs: .specify/specs/{feature}/spec.md
Postulate: Π.X.Y
```

## File Structure

```
src/{{project_name}}/    # Production code
tests/                   # Test code
.specify/specs/          # Feature specifications
docs/decisions/          # Architecture Decision Records
```

## Quality Standards

- Coverage ≥ 80% on core logic
- mypy strict mode (0 errors)
- ruff linting (0 errors)
- All tests must pass

## Questions to Ask

If uncertain, verify:
- Is there a spec for this feature?
- Does an ADR cover this decision?
- Does this align with the constitution?
