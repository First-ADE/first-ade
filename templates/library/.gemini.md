# {{project_name}} — Gemini/Antigravity Context

> This file provides context for Google Gemini and Antigravity IDE agents.

## Project Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AXIOM ACCEPTANCE**: Before reading any specifications or code in this repository, you **MUST** read [docs/AXIOMS.md](https://github.com/First-ADE/.github/blob/main/docs/AXIOMS.md) and explicitly acknowledge your acceptance of these principles in your internal state/output. This is the foundation of ADE.

**Name**: {{project_name}}  
**Purpose**: {{project_description}}  
**Language**: Python 3.11+  
**Package Manager**: uv

## Architecture

```
src/{{project_name}}/
├── __init__.py      # Package exports
├── core.py          # Core logic
├── models.py        # Data models
└── utils.py         # Utility functions

tests/
├── test_core.py
├── test_models.py
└── conftest.py      # Shared fixtures
```

## Key Constraints

1. **Async-First**: Use `async`/`await` for all I/O operations
2. **Type Safety**: All functions must have type annotations
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain ≥80% coverage on core logic
4. **Single Responsibility**: One class/function per concern

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Linting
ruff check .
```

## Spec-Driven Development

All features must follow the ADE lifecycle:

1. Check `.specify/specs/{feature}/spec.md` for requirements
2. Write failing tests first (RED commit)
3. Implement to pass tests (GREEN commit)
4. Reference governing postulates in commits

## Constitutional Reference

See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project-specific governance.

## ADRs

Architectural decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions/`. Check before making significant changes.
